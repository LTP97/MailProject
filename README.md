Work in progress

Simple Mail

Basic Mail application with javafx, sqlserver, hibernate and jakarta mail

Connects directly to existing email accounts and uses their servers to send and receive emails.
All common mail operations work. (Answer/Forward/Attachments/write mail)

Multiple accounts supported

Attachments and/or lots of mails at once can slow down the synchronization a lot! 
So please be patient when using accounts with lots of mails in their inbox.

Currently only supports GMX-Accounts - wrong account type entry breaks the app.
To run set up resources.config.properties.

Future improvements:
Improve synchronization performance(change message fetching approach), add custom mail provider entry, add gmail authentication
Mail-Signatures, display and edit html message content, delete function, trashbin, individual folder/label structure
